What does package.json do?
The package.json file stores the important information about a Node.js project, defining metadata such as the project name, the version, and the author. It also contains scripts that can be ran using npm.

What is process.env?
Process.env is an object that is provided by Node.js that contains environment variables available to the running program. These variables are usually set outside of the code and are used for the configuration.

What does npm start run?
Npm start runs the command that is defined under the “start” script in the package.json file.

Bugs or Errors I occurred. 
During this assignment, I mistakenly wrote the Node version as a literal value instead of using the correct process.version property.
